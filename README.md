<b>How to run:</b>

    - If using google colab create a folder in your drive called '_COLAB', otherwise don't run the first code cell.

    - If models are aviable, put the necessary files in a folder called 'models' in your workspace.

    - In the second code cell select the graphs' txt files you want to analyze by storing their names without the extensions in the 'files' list. Then store in the 'directed' list True if the file with corresponding index represents a directed graph, false otherwise. 
    Note that the data files should be stored in the 'data' folder.

    - After a full run you will find the results in the 'plot' folder
